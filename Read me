## Project Overview

This portfolio project is a reflection of my dedication to web development. By using Bootstrap, I've structured various sections, including a navigation bar, hero section, work section, skills section, about/contact section, and a footer. The primary aim is to present my skills and projects in a well-organized and visually appealing manner.

## Committing Guidelines

To keep track of my progress and maintain an active repository, I will try commiting early and often. Each commit comes with clear and descriptive messages. My goal is to surpass 200 commits by graduation.

## Folder Structure

Ensuring a clean and organized project, the folder structure includes:

- `css/`: Home to the stylesheet (`style.css`).
- `images/`: A repository for all project images.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file showcasing my portfolio.

## Bootstrap Implementation

Leveraging Bootstrap has allowed me to create the following sections:

1. **Navigation Bar:**
   - Using Bootstrap's navigation menu, I've crafted a custom navbar with relevant links for seamless navigation.

2. **Hero Section:**
   - Bootstrap's jumbotron sets the stage for an engaging introduction, featuring a captivating picture, my name, and additional details.

3. **Work Section:**
   - Projects are presented in a grid using Bootstrap cards, each providing a brief overview and a link to the deployed application.

4. **Skills Section:**
   - This section lists out the skills I'm eager to acquire during the boot camp.

5. **About/Contact Section:**
   - An About Me section provides insights into my journey.

6. **Footer Section:**
   - Hyperlinks exhibit hover effects, and buttons showcase box shadows upon hover.

I've aimed to minimize the use of media queries, ensuring a streamlined Bootstrap solution.
